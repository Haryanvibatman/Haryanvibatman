💻 Learning to build real-world intelligent systems

🚀 Goal: To become an AI Engineer and build impactful tech

🧠 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing rules:

We give machines data, and they find the patterns.

🔍 Types of Machine Learning
Type	Description	Example
📘 Supervised Learning	Learns from labeled data	Spam email detection
📗 Unsupervised Learning	Finds patterns in unlabeled data	Customer segmentation
📙 Reinforcement Learning	Learns through rewards & penalties	Game-playing AI
⚙️ ML Workflow
Data Collection → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment
